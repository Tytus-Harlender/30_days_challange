Threading - Asynchronicity

1. Threading

 Threading description initialized
 In the 'Program.cs' we may see a creation of worker thread processing the method 'Print()'.
 THe idea behind it is to devide task of the program among more then one executing process (thread).
 A commonly followed rule is to create max 2 threads per each core of our processor.
