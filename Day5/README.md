Comparison of struct and a class – ‘sealed’ keyword -  difference between overloading and overriding

1.	Struct vs class

Struct is a storage of data in it’s type, which is a value type (in contrary to class which is a reference type). They are then often located on a stack. Structs have a default public members. We may see usage of a struct in StructExample class. We first define the struct and later assign values to it’s members, which will be further displayed. Note that all members are public and that we do not use new keyword for initializing the struct. In .NET there are already some built-in structs which don’t need to be defined as DateTime.
