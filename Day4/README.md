What do the terms “boxing” and “unboxing” mean? (Exmaples in code) What is the difference between a class and an object, and how do these terms relate to each other? What is value type and reference type? (examples in code)

1.	Boxing and unboxing

2.	Class and object



3.	Value type and reference type – two basic kind of types in C#

Value type variable contains an instance of the type. With value types, each variable has its own copy of the data, and it is not possible for operations on one variable to affect the other (except in, out and ref keywords usage)

Reference type variable contains a reference to an instance of the type. With reference types, two variables can reference the same object; therefore, operations on one variable can affect the object referenced by the other variable.
